# Reproducing 'Deformation Transfer for Triangle Meshes'
## Introduction
This project is a homework assignment for Computer Graphics (CG).  
Our goal is to transfer the change in shape exhibited by the source deformation onto the target.structural consistency.  

**We assume that the source and target meshes have the same number of vertices or triangles.**
